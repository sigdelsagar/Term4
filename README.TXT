Assignment 1 of PROG5001-2022-T4 Fundamentals of Programming

Task Description:

Your task is to develop a simple Java program to manage student marks. Your work must demonstrate your learning over the first two modules of this unit. The program will have the following functional requirements:
• F1: Allow users to input the unit name
• F2: Allow users to input the students’ marks.
In this task, you can assume that there are 25 students in the unit. Your program must accept only valid marks input by users. A valid mark is any number between 0 and 100.
• F3: Any invalid input must be reported by showing an error message on the screen before allowing users to re-enter the mark.
• F4: Print the unit name following with the students’ marks after users have finished entering the marks.
• F5: Find the highest mark and the lowest mark and print the result on the screen (Algorithm 1)
• F6: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the marks and print the result on the screen (Algorithm 2)
